## Papers (in chronological order)

1) Réville et al. 2015, The Effect of Magnetic Topology on Thermally Driven Wind: Toward a General Formulation of the Braking Law

- The values of the parameter Upsilon open shown in the paper lack a normalization factor $1/(4\pi)$
- Consequently the fitted parameter $K_3$ should be changed from $1.4$ to $0.65 = 1.4 (1/4\pi)^{0.31}$
- Subsequent papers have integrated the modification
- Minus sign of equation 15 should be removed
- In the legend of Figure 9: $\Phi_{open}$ should be replaced by $v_A / v_{esc}$

2) Réville et al. 2015, From Solar to Stellar Corona: The Role of Wind, Rotation, and Magnetism

- No error detected

3) Réville et al. 2016, Age Dependence of Wind Properties for Solar-type Stars: A 3D Study

- Solar magnetograms are flipped upside down. No influence on the main results.

4) Réville & Brun 2017, Global Solar Magnetic Field Organization in the Outer Corona: Influence on the Solar Wind Speed and Mass Flux Over the Cycle

- Same as above. Solar Magnetograms are flipped upside down. No influence on the main results.
- Discussion on the measured mass loss by Ulysses is incorrect. The mass flux is clearly positvely correlated with the sunspot number. See Finley et al. 2018, doi:10.3847/1538-4357/aad7b6

5) Réville et al. 2018, Parametric Decay and the Origin of the Low-frequency Alfvénic Spectrum of the Solar Wind

- No error detected

6) Réville et al. 2020, The Role of Alfvén Wave Dynamics on the Large-scale Properties of the Solar Wind: Comparing an MHD Simulation with Parker Solar Probe E1 Data

- See erratum

7) Réville et al. 2020, Tearing Instability and Periodic Density Perturbations in the Slow Solar Wind

- The dipolar magnetic field amplitude is actually 3G at the pole (not 5G at the equator)

8) Réville et al. 2021, Investigating the origin of the FIP effect with a shell turbulence model

- Same as above (for the PLUTO simulation)
- Fig 2. T is given in K (not MK)
- Error in Saha's numerical implementation. Affects very slightly Figure 5 and 6.

9) Réville et al. 2022, Flux rope and dynamics of the heliospheric current sheet. Study of the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter conjunction of June 2020

- No error detected 

10) Parenti et al. 2022, Validation of a Wave Heated 3D MHD Coronal-wind Model using Polarized Brightness and EUV Observations

- Appendix A. The turbulence correlation lengthscale is 0.02 solar radii, as in Réville et al. 2020 ApJS (not 0.002 $R_{\odot}$).

11) Réville et al. 2023, HelioCast: heliospheric forecasting based on white-light observations of the solar corona.

- Figure 6. The $V_r$ plot is made with $v_f$=700 km/s in equation (6) (it should be 750 km/s).

12) Réville et al. 2024, Magnetized Winds of M-type Stars and Star–Planet Magnetic Interactions: Uncertainties and Modeling Strategy

- There is a typo in the reflection coefficient expression: $\mathcal{R}^\pm = | V_{A,r} \nabla_r \ln \sqrt{\rho}| \times MAX()$ (the root goes inside the log)
